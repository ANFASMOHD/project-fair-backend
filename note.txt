                                          Node Js
                                       -------------
            is not a programing language 
            it provide a runtime environment for javascript to run outside the browser
            it provides some javascript libraries along with it.
            it is opensource server environment 
            
            how php and asp.Net handle
             the request accept-->resovle--->send the reponse back--->ready to accept another request.
             node js
             accept request first request---->send to resolve the first request--`-->readt to accept--->reponse send 


             features
             ---------
             Extremly Faster -browser engine (v8)
             based on asyncgronous programming
             single  threaded
             highly scalable

             what are modules in Node .js-
             ---------
             each files/javascript libraries  inside a node js is called modules
              modules are of two types 
              - custome modules
              - builtIn modules

              inorder to use these modules we need Imports Exports these modules.
              import-Require('')-ESS
              export -Module.Exports
                 -export


              BuiltIn modules
              -----------
              file System: Node.js file System Modules allows you to work with the file System in your programing
              
              import statement -var variable=require('fs')
              common uses
              Read file-fs.readFile()

              create file-fs.open()
              update file -fs.writeFile()
              Delelte file -fs.unlink()
              Rename  file-fs.rename()

2) Http module 
---- it allows node.js to transfer data over the http 
       - geneating http requests.
       -http module can create a http server the listern to server ports and gives a response back to the client  
      -createServer()-method to create http server
3)- event module -to create events -
  class eventmitter ()= object 
  4) crypto =encryption ,hashing 

  Backend Concept
  ---------
  client server architecture -sending request and response between two application
  api-application programming interface 
  Restfulapi-http and json
  CRUD-create read update delete 
  CORS-cross origin resource sharing .(frontend will be running on one port and the backend will be running on another port number)

Server Creation
---------
1-   create a folder for the server
2-   install packag.json    nom init -y
3   -edit the script key in pakge.json
4-
install-
express - framework of node.js - installation-npm i express
cors   - installation - npm i cors
dotenv - as a zero dependency module that loads environment variable from .env file to process .env
environment variables :provides information about the environment in which the process is running 
npm i express cors dotenv
5-create .env file to holds environment variable
6- create .gitignore
mention -   node_modules
              .env inside files

7- create index.js file expecially        
       


 
9) create controller file 
-logic to resolve file client request 


mvc architecture
-----------
-VIEW-frontent 
-ROUTING-to set path to resolve request 
-CONTROLLER-to write  logic to resolve 
MODEL- structure to store data in database
-DATABASE- to store database


MONGODB
 USED to store

 -commands
 ----------
 1) show database- to get all database inside mongodb
 2) usedatabase_name- to change diectory to move into a particular database
 3) show collection -to get all collection in a database
 4)db.users.find().sort ({username:1})-accending
 5)db.users.find().sort ({username:-1})-deccending



 JWT
 _________

it define compact and self contain for securly transmitting information between to parties as json object 


middle ware

there two types of middle ware

application middle ware--
ROUTING middle ware
